---------------

Credit Up For All has one credit product called Contigo. Depending on risk, the customer will receive:

1. Contigo A given to high risk customers: $1,000 loan to be paid in full after one month with 15% interest. 

2. Contigo B given to low risk customers: $2,000 loan to be paid in full after one month with 10% interest. 


Past debt delinquency (DQ) rates have determined the interest for both products. Is estimated that the monthly DQ rate A will be 13.5% and 8% for B, throughout this year.

Contigo B has the largest share of customers, 10,000 in total. But with a very competitive market for premium loans, Contigo B is expected to grow at a 10% month over month rate throughout the year. The operation of this startup scales proportionately to its customer base, with negligible fixed expenses.
